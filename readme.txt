== Description ==

Wordpress Plugin that helps you monetize your wordpress site easily. 

Currently utilises AdFly, Vivads, SolveMedia, or any Ad Network to maximise profits created from your website. 

- AdFly: Allows you to create shortlinks where users are sent to an ad first. Can convert all links on your site or you can include or exclude different linked domains. Comes with a few options that allow you to protect your site like nofollow, https etc. Adfly also allows you to display an ad when users visit your site making it even easier to apply.

- Vivads: Is very similar to AdFly but with limited options. You should choose between 1 or the other but can be used together if Vivads converts your links but AdFly is displayed when users visit. [Create Vivads Account](http://vivads.net/ref/second2none)
- SolveMedia: Provides a captcha service that displays ads and can currently be applied to Login, Registration, and the Lost Password forms. SolveMedia also allows you to lock content with a captcha.
- Custom Ads: Add Custom HTML / Javascript from your Favourite Ad Network, from Display Ads to Offer Walls, Content Lockers + More
